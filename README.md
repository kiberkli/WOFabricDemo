Quick demo for drawing in a canvas using Fabric.js and sending the image data to a Wonder app.

Fabric.js can be found at http://fabricjs.com. It's included in this repository only to make the demo functional.
This demo only shows basic line drawing capabilities.  Any other features should be implemented as desired - Fabric.js demos: http://fabricjs.com/demos/
